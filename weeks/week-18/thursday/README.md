# Express API Starter Project

This project includes the packages and babel setup for an express server, and is just meant to make things a little simpler to get up and running with.

## Getting started

Install dependencies with `npm install`, then start the server by running `npm run dev`

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
