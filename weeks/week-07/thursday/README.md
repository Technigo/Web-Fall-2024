**Question:**
I'm having trouble with the styling, and I would really like to achieve a design that looks as close as possible to the one in Figma. How would you do to fill out the red-filled box? I do not want the sun and temperature to be on the same level...Maybe lots of margin above the large temperature number? Grid or flex columns with a set height? Tell me your thoughts :-D I also want it to be responsive of course.
