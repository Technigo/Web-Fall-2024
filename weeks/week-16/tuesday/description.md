## Fix the errors!
### Exercises to practise TypeScript by fixing the errors
The idea is that you open the exercises with the naming `*.problem` in the end of the file name. There you will face some errors. Hover over the red squiggly lines to read the error messages and figure out how to make the code bug free.
When the errors are gone, you have found the solution.
If you want to you can run the code file to do the typecheck.
If you get stuck, take a sneak peak into the files with `*.solution` in the file name.

```sh
# Installs all dependencies
npm install

# Asks you which exercise you'd like to run, pick one in the list and it runs it
npm run exercise
```
